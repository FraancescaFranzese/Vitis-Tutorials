# Implementing an IIR Filter on the AI Engine - Part 1b

***Version: Vitis 2024.2***

## Recap

In Part 1a, we calculated eight outputs of a second-order section of an IIR filter *in parallel* using the AI Engine.

This section shows how to modify the ADF graph and the testbench for a sixth-order elliptical lowpass filter.

## Julia Script

`aie_iir_1b.jl` is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) script which can design and generate the required SIMD coefficients for an arbitrary IIR filter.

In its pristine state, the user parameters are as follows:

```Julia
first_set = true;	# true: 1st set; false: 2nd set

if first_set
    fp = 10.0e6         	# passband frequency
    coeff_file_suffix = "a"	# file suffix to distinguish different coefficient sets
                        	# with the same architecture
else
    fp = 20.0e6         	# passband frequency
    coeff_file_suffix = "b" 	# 2nd set of coefficients
end # if first_set

fs = 100.0e6            # sampling frequency
p = 6                   # no. of poles
rp = 0.1                # passband ripple (dB)
rs = 80.0               # stopband attenuation (dB)
N = 256                 # no. of samples for impulse response
show_plots = true       # display plots?
write_cmatrix = true    # write C matrix to files?
write_impulse = true    # write impulse response?
```

Start Julia and run the script using the following commands:

```
julia> cd("{specify_path_to_aie_iir_1b.jl}")
julia> include("aie_iir_1b.jl")
```

This plots the filter characteristics and generates three coefficient files (C[1~3]a.h), as there are six poles in the filter.

![Fig. 1](./images/filt10.PNG "6<sup>th</sup> order elliptical LPF, BW=10MHz")

The kernel code remains the same, but the ADF graph and testbench must be slightly modified to accommodate the additional sections.

Move the generated `*.dat` files into the `data` directory and the generated `*.h` files (coefficient files) into the `src` directory.

## Adaptive Dataflow (ADF) Graph

The modified ADF graph looks like this:

`graph.hpp`

```C++
#ifndef __GRAPH_H__			// include guard to prevent multiple inclusion

	#define __GRAPH_H__

	#include <adf.h>		// Adaptive DataFlow header

	#include "kernel.hpp"

	using namespace adf;

	// dataflow graph declaration
	class the_graph : public graph {	// inherit all properties of the adaptive     dataflow graph

		private:
			kernel section1;
			kernel section2;
			kernel section3;

		public:
			input_plio in;		// input port for data to enter the kernel
			input_port cmtx1;	// input port for SIMD matrix coefficients
			input_port cmtx2;
			input_port cmtx3;
			output_plio out;	// output port for data to leave the kernel

			// constructor
			the_graph() {

				// associate the kernel with the function to be executed
				section1 = kernel::create(SecondOrderSection<1>);
				section2 = kernel::create(SecondOrderSection<2>);
				section3 = kernel::create(SecondOrderSection<3>);

				// declare data widths and files for simulation
				#ifndef RTP_SWITCH
					in = input_plio::create(plio_32_bits, "data/input.dat");
				#else
					in = input_plio::create(plio_32_bits, "data/two_freqs.dat");
				#endif // RTP_SWITCH
				out = output_plio::create(plio_32_bits, "output.dat");

				const unsigned num_samples = 8;

				// declare buffer sizes
				dimensions(section1.in[0]) = {num_samples};
				dimensions(section1.out[0]) = {num_samples};

				dimensions(section2.in[0]) = {num_samples};
				dimensions(section2.out[0]) = {num_samples};

				dimensions(section3.in[0]) = {num_samples};
				dimensions(section3.out[0]) = {num_samples};

				// establish connections
				connect(in.out[0], section1.in[0]);			
				connect<parameter>(cmtx1, adf::async(section1.in[1]));

				connect(section1.out[0], section2.in[0]);
				connect<parameter>(cmtx2, adf::async(section2.in[1]));

				connect(section2.out[0], section3.in[0]);
				connect<parameter>(cmtx3, adf::async(section3.in[1]));

				connect(section3.out[0], out.in[0]);

				// specify which source code file contains the kernel function
				source(section1) = "kernel.cpp";
				source(section2) = "kernel.cpp";
				source(section3) = "kernel.cpp";

				// !!! temporary value: assumes this kernel dominates the AI Engine tile !!!
				runtime<ratio>(section1) = 1.0;
				runtime<ratio>(section2) = 1.0;
				runtime<ratio>(section3) = 1.0;

			} // end the_graph()

	}; // end class the_graph

#endif // __GRAPH_H__
```

***Notes:***

* Two additional kernels (sections) are added.
* Two additional `input_port` declarations for the coefficients of the new sections are added.
* Two additional `kernel::create()` statements are added.
* The [network topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology) are modified such that the three sections are cascaded.
* Additional `source()` and `runtime<ratio>()` statements are added.

## Testbench Code

The testbench may look something like this:

`tb.cpp`

```C++
//#define RTP_SWITCH		// comment out to check impulse response

#include "kernel.hpp"
#include "graph.hpp"
#include "C1a.h"
#include "C2a.h"
#include "C3a.h"

#ifdef RTP_SWITCH
	#include "C1b.h"
	#include "C2b.h"
	#include "C3b.h"
#endif // RTP_SWITCH

using namespace std;
using namespace adf;

// specify the DFG
the_graph my_graph;

const unsigned num_pts = 256;						// number of sample points in "input.dat"

#ifndef RTP_SWITCH
	const unsigned num_iterations = num_pts/8;		// number of iterations to run
#else
	const unsigned num_iterations = num_pts/8/2;	// number of iterations to run
#endif // RTP_SWITCH

// main simulation program
int main() {

	my_graph.init();	// load the DFG into the AI Engine array, establish connectivity, etc.

	my_graph.update(my_graph.cmtx1, C1a, 96);
	my_graph.update(my_graph.cmtx2, C2a, 96);
	my_graph.update(my_graph.cmtx3, C3a, 96);

	#ifndef RTP_SWITCH
		my_graph.run(num_iterations);	// run the DFG for the specified number of iterations
	#else
		// run with set "a" for 1st half
		my_graph.run(num_iterations);	// run the DFG for the specified number of iterations
		my_graph.wait();	// wait for all iterations to finish before loading new coefficients

		// load set "b"
		my_graph.update(my_graph.cmtx1, C1b, 96);
		my_graph.update(my_graph.cmtx2, C2b, 96);
		my_graph.update(my_graph.cmtx3, C3b, 96);

		my_graph.run(num_iterations);	// run the DFG for the specified number of iterations

	#endif // RTP_SWITCH

	my_graph.end();	// housekeeping

	return (0);

} // end main()
```

***Notes:***

* With `#define RTP_SWITCH` commented out, only one set of coefficients is loaded and we can check the impulse response as before.
* An additional set of coefficients is included for the other sections.
* Additional `my_graph.update()` statements are added for the other sections.

## Building and Running the Design

We use `Emulation-SW` to verify the functionality of the design. Similar to Part1a, we can use Julia to calculate the maximum value of the absolute error between the reference and the generated impulse response (run `check1.jl`). The impulse response error for this three-stage design is as follows:

![Fig. 2](./images/impresp_error.PNG "Impulse Response Error")

## Changing Coefficients During Runtime

We set `first_set` to `false` in `aie_iir_1b.jl` as follows to generate another set of coefficients for an LPF with a passband of 20 MHz.

```Julia
first_set = false;	# true: 1st set; false: 2nd set
...
```

The frequency response with a 20MHz passband is as follows:

![Fig. 3](./images/filt20.PNG "6th order elliptical LPF, BW=20MHz")

Move the generated `*.h` (coefficient files) to `src` and `impresponse_b.dat` to `data`.

We use `two_freqs.jl` to generate an input signal (`two_freqs.dat`) with two frequencies (f1 = 2 MHz, f2 = 18 MHz) to test the functionality of coefficient switching. The time and frequency domain plots of the signal are as follows:

![Fig. 4](./images/two_freqs.PNG "Input Signal with Two Frequency Components")

Move the generated `two_freqs.dat` to `data`.

In the testbench (`tb.cpp`), we *uncomment* `#define RTP_SWITCH` to include the second set of coefficients.

***Note:*** A `wait()` statement is *required* to allow the specified number of iterations to complete before loading the new set of coefficients.

The output of the AI Engines is as follows (use `check2.jl`):

![Fig. 5](./images/switched_output.PNG "AI Engine Output with Coefficient Switching")

The first half of the plot used coefficients for a 10 MHz filter. Thus, only the noisy 2 MHz component passed and the 18 MHz component was significantly attenuated.

In the second half, the coefficients are for a 20 MHz filter. Thus, both 2 MHz and 18 MHz components are seen at the output.

The complete design is included in the `data` and `src` directories. Refer to the aie_exp/Part1 tutorial if you are unfamiliar with building an AMD Vitis™ design from scratch.

## Conclusion

We showed how a sixth-order IIR filter composed of three second-order sections is cascaded in the ADF graph.

We also showed how changing coefficients at runtime using asynchronous runtime parameters is possible.

In Part 1, we focused only on functional verification using `Emulation-SW`. We will analyze the design and optimize it for throughput in upcoming installments.
