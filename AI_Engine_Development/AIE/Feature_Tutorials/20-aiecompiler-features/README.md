# AI Engine Compiler Features

***Version: Vitis 2024.2***
 
## Introduction

## Introduction

The `aiecompiler` is evolving and therefore it may be difficult for you to keep up with new features. This tutorial shares a variety of features that are useful for AI Engine / AI Engine-ML (AIE-ML) programming to create more visible and efficient code compared to early versions of the compiler.

>**IMPORTANT**: Before beginning the tutorial, make sure that you have installed the AMD Vitis™ Unified Software Platform 2024.2.  

Data generation for this tutorial requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The following packages are required:

- os
- sys
- numpy

All these designs will compile for AI Engine architecture (VCK190 production board using `ARCH=aie` in `make` command line) and the AI Engine ML architecture (VEK280 board using `ARCH=aie-ml` in `make` command line)

## Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Work with multirate design that allow the compiler to handle frame length mismatch between consecutive kernels in a kernel chain.
- Send output data to different other kernels for stream-based and buffer-based I/O.
- Conditionally instantiate graph objects.

This tutorial is based on simple data passthrough to avoid another level of complexity.


## Tutorial Sections


| Section Link | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [Conditional Objects](ConditionalObjects) | Shows how to conditionally instantiate graph objects |
| [Multirate](Multirate) | Explains how to handle mismatching frame length in between kernels |
| [Multicast](Multicast) | Provides examples on how to manipulate stream/buffer multicasting with multirate |
